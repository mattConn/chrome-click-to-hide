# Click-to-hide
Chrome extension to delete element on page by clicking on it. Useful for ads and other page blocking elements.

## To Install:
Clone this repository, unzip, and drag the folder (which should be named "chrome-click-to-hide-master") into Chrome after navigating to chrome://extensions/ .

## To Use:
After installation, click on the Click-to-hide icon (which will be a letter "C") alongside your other Chrome extension icons to enable the extension. You will know that the extension is enabled when you see your cursor appear as a crosshair. The script will then be enabled for one click at a time; this is the current limitation.

Cick on any element on the page to effectively remove or hide it. To remove another element on the page, click on the extension icon again to re-enable, and repeat this process for any remaining elements on the page that you wish to remove.
